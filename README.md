# 🤝 CONNECTLY

## Welcome to **Connectly – Where Shared Experiences Truly Connect!**

**Connectly** is a social storytelling web app designed for everyday users to share personal stories, ideas, and inspiration — from travel and culture to lifestyle and local gems. Think of it as a digital wall of voices, where every post is a meaningful piece of a shared experience.

Connectly offers a space to:

- 📝 Create and publish posts with text, tags, and images
- 🏷️ Browse by topics, countries, or categories
- 💬 Comment and engage with others' posts
- 📸 Share photos and personal experiences
- 🔍 Filter and search for content by interest or region

## 💡 Why We Built It

We created **Connectly** to make storytelling feel personal again. Most social media platforms today focus on virality, likes, and trends — not meaningful experiences.

Every user can:

- Post freely on topics they care about
- Upload meaningful images or travel content
- Use tags to make content discoverable
- Interact directly and respectfully with others
